        <p>The world-famous road to Hana is one of the must-do experiences when visiting Maui. It can be overwhelming planning what to see on this iconic road trip when you have limited time. So we’ve rounded up all the road to Hana stops that we did on Maui’s epic coastal drive. You don’t have to see everything (unless you have the time) so we are here to help you choose what are the top stops that you must make.</p>
        <p>The Road to Hana, aka The Hana Highway, takes you from the surf town of Paia to the peaceful town of Hana. It’s easy to find the best stops on the road to Hana, all you need to do is follow the mile markers. We have included the mile marker for each stop on the Hana Highway in this guide. It is a great addition to any Maui vacation.</p>
        <p>Most people make a day trip out of the road to Hana drive and begin in Paia in the morning spending the rest of the day working their way out to Hana Town stopping along the way. We instead drove directly out to Hana before sunrise to explore Hana Town and its nearby attractions before making our way back slowly in the afternoon. It was the best decision we made. We avoided the traffic and had many of the top stops on the Road to Hana all to ourselves.</p>
        <p>The Hana Highway is one of the most popular day trips on Maui, so it can get very busy fast. We recommend leaving early and driving directly to the Pools at O’he’o Gulch part of Haleakala National Park which is about 30 minutes beyond Hana. Getting there early beats the crowds and you can hike the Pipiwai Trail to Waimoku Falls in relative peace and quiet and then, you can then spend the day slowly making your way back to Paia.</p>
        <p>Traffic on the road to Hana from Paia to Hana is plugged and stopped later in the day. Seeing the sights in reverse order, lets you enjoy the viewpoints and waterfalls at your own pace. Plus, we found the views on the way back, way better than on the way out as we were on the right side of the road with unobstructed views!</p>

        title: "SINDHUDURG FORT - WHY DID CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ BUILT THIS FORT?",
        postImage: "./images/travel/Sindhudurg-Fort.jpg",
        content: `
        <p>Sindhudurg fort was built by Shivaji in the sea to bolster the Maratha presence in the Arabian Sea during the time of many strong naval nations coming to India for trade, and possibly more. The fort is located on an island just off the coast of Malvan beach in Konkan and was built in 1664. In fact Shivaji built a series of sea forts, including the Alibag and Padmagad forts, and this proved strategically brilliant later.</p>
        <p>Spread over 47 acres, Sindhudurg is the largest sea fort in the world as per this article by Conde Nast Traveller. It is a reputed magazine so I do trust the information they share, but frankly I couldn't verify this anywhere else online.</p>
        <p>As with many of the sea forts, the entrance to the fort is concealed and you can reach only if you know exactly where that is. The narrow entrance passage is made in such a way that if the enemy enters, they can easily be attacked by the defending army and weakened at the entrance itself.</p>
        <p>The fort also has a temple dedicated to Shivaji which is a must-visit.</p>
