        title: "ROAD TO HANA: HIGHWAY MAP, THINGS TO DO AND TIPS",

        <p>The world-famous road to Hana is one of the must-do experiences when visiting Maui. It can be overwhelming planning what to see on this iconic road trip when you have limited time. So we’ve rounded up all the road to Hana stops that we did on Maui’s epic coastal drive. You don’t have to see everything (unless you have the time) so we are here to help you choose what are the top stops that you must make.</p>
        <p>The Road to Hana, aka The Hana Highway, takes you from the surf town of Paia to the peaceful town of Hana. It’s easy to find the best stops on the road to Hana, all you need to do is follow the mile markers. We have included the mile marker for each stop on the Hana Highway in this guide. It is a great addition to any Maui vacation.</p>
        <p>Most people make a day trip out of the road to Hana drive and begin in Paia in the morning spending the rest of the day working their way out to Hana Town stopping along the way. We instead drove directly out to Hana before sunrise to explore Hana Town and its nearby attractions before making our way back slowly in the afternoon. It was the best decision we made. We avoided the traffic and had many of the top stops on the Road to Hana all to ourselves.</p>
        <p>The Hana Highway is one of the most popular day trips on Maui, so it can get very busy fast. We recommend leaving early and driving directly to the Pools at O’he’o Gulch part of Haleakala National Park which is about 30 minutes beyond Hana. Getting there early beats the crowds and you can hike the Pipiwai Trail to Waimoku Falls in relative peace and quiet and then, you can then spend the day slowly making your way back to Paia.</p>
        <p>Traffic on the road to Hana from Paia to Hana is plugged and stopped later in the day. Seeing the sights in reverse order, lets you enjoy the viewpoints and waterfalls at your own pace. Plus, we found the views on the way back, way better than on the way out as we were on the right side of the road with unobstructed views!</p>

        title: "SINDHUDURG FORT - WHY DID CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ BUILT THIS FORT?",
        postImage: "./images/travel/Sindhudurg-Fort.jpg",
        content: `
        <p>Sindhudurg fort was built by Shivaji in the sea to bolster the Maratha presence in the Arabian Sea during the time of many strong naval nations coming to India for trade, and possibly more. The fort is located on an island just off the coast of Malvan beach in Konkan and was built in 1664. In fact Shivaji built a series of sea forts, including the Alibag and Padmagad forts, and this proved strategically brilliant later.</p>
        <p>Spread over 47 acres, Sindhudurg is the largest sea fort in the world as per this article by Conde Nast Traveller. It is a reputed magazine so I do trust the information they share, but frankly I couldn't verify this anywhere else online.</p>
        <p>As with many of the sea forts, the entrance to the fort is concealed and you can reach only if you know exactly where that is. The narrow entrance passage is made in such a way that if the enemy enters, they can easily be attacked by the defending army and weakened at the entrance itself.</p>
        <p>The fort also has a temple dedicated to Shivaji which is a must-visit.</p>

        title: "BEYOND GHATS AND GULLIES – PLACES TO VISIT NEAR VARANASI",
        postImage: "./images/travel/Aurwathand-Dam.jpg",

        <p>Rocks and ravines, canyons and cliffs, waterfalls and valleys, forts and stupas, pre-historic art, and artisans – there are so many tourist places to visit near Varanasi beyond temples and rivers, ghats, and gullies. There are rugged terrains that hold many secrets. Rocks that tell a story through art. Sacred stupas and silent sculptures add to the hallowed land. Formidable forts, lost ruins, and ancient monasteries create a tableau of stories. I have been to Varanasi quite a few times but I was fascinated by the landscapes around these destinations. For a moment I wondered if I am still in Uttar Pradesh or have wandered into Madhya Pradesh. If you are looking for heritage and offbeat places around Varanasi, then here are five fascinating places to visit near Varanasi that you can explore.</p>

        <p>The mystical and historic Chunar Fort, located barely 30 km away from Varanasi and equidistant from Mirzapur tells so many stories.  Overlooking the River Ganga, the settlements around the fort date back to 56 BC to the reign of Raja Vikramaditya. According to a legend, the king visited the forests in this region looking for his brother, Bharatthari, who was living here as a recluse and a hermit. The king built a small house here for him and even today, a black stone, worshipped by the locals is believed to be possessed by the spirit of the saint who is invisible and lives around the fort.</p>
        <p>Historic records point to the 11th century when the fort was actually built but it was rebuilt later by the Mughals and the British. Battles between Mughal king Humayan and the Pathan, Sher Shah Suri, or Sher Khan have been documented here. Later the British took over the fortress and the inhuman dungeons beneath the barracks were used as prisons. Even today the ghosts of the past and the eerie stories lend it a touch of the mystical and the supernatural.</p>
        <p>Mystically however Chunar Fort is filled with legends and is the land of the Chandrakanta novels and is called Chandrakanta Chunargarh.  It is also believed that Bhagwan Vishnu or Bawaan Bhagwan, in the “avtaar” of Vamana set foot on this terrain, and hence it is also called Charanadri. When Bhagwan Vishnu asked Maharaja Bali for three feet of land, he readily agreed. Bhagwan placed his foot on the universe, here mythically and symbolically representing the region around Chunar Fort. One of the priests in the small temple in the fort complex said the land around the fort is blessed and we are on hallowed land. Even today it is believed that God lives in the fort and goes to Varanasi for three hours when the fortress is believed to be vulnerable. As a storyteller I love listening to mystical tales and Chunar is literally my kind of destination. It surprised me at every step with the many tableau of stories and layers of history that I peeled as I explored the fortress.</p>

        title: "PLACES TO SEE IN TANAKPUR IN UTTARAKHAND",
        postImage: "./images/travel/Tanakpur-Sharda-Ghat.jpg",
        content: `
        <p>Located on the foothills of the Himalayas and on the banks of the Sharda River and surrounded by dense forests is the charming town of Tanakpur in Uttarakhand. Rugged and raw with pristine views, Tanakpur is often referred to as the ” Gateway to the Kumaon Himalayas. ”  The town is also adjacent to the Nepal border as a bridge across the Sharda River separates India from Nepal. However, Tanakpur is also a destination for pilgrims and devotees as the Devi Purnagiri Temple is located 20 kms from the town and you have to do a short trek of 3 km uphill to reach the temple which is one of the 108 Shakti Peethas. There are several tourist places near Tanakpur from lakes, forests, and temples, and here are some of the places to see in Tanakpur.</p>
        <h3>Maa Purnagiri Temple</h3>
        <p>The divine mythological legend of Mahadev Shiva and Ma Parvati as the deities Shiva and Sati is retold here. It was believed that Lord Shiva as a Yogi had married Sati against the wishes of her father and king, Dakha Prajapati and he performed a Vrihaspati Yagna without inviting them. When Sati went there alone, she was humiliated as her father insulted Lord Shiva and she immolated herself in the sacrificial fire. An angry Lord Shiva in grief carried Sati’s body in his arms and performed the dance of destruction. It is believed that parts of her body fell at different regions and they became known as Shakti Peethams. At Purnagiri it is believed that her navel or “naabi” had fallen and the temple was later built here. One of the oldest temples, it is always thronged by devotees, especially around spring in March- April, during Chaitra Navaratri.</p>
        <p>Another popular temple, located on the banks of the Sharda River is the Boom Temple, also called Adhya Shakti Peeth. It is believed to be under the auspices of the spiritual and mystical Guru Maa and the shrines here are dedicated to the Hindu pantheon of Goddesses who are forms of Shakti or Ma Parvati.</p>
        <h3>Sharda Ghat</h3>
        <p>One of the most pristine ghats, the Sharda Ghat is also called Ma Purnagiri Ghat. The turquoise waters of the river Sharda surrounded by the mountains look straight out of a picture postcard. But this is also one of the holiest of all ghats as most pilgrims and devotees have their ablutions here before visiting the temple.</p>
