        <p>SIAM (Society Of Indian Automobile Manufacturers) has released numbers for the period of April-December 2022. The first nine months of the financial year saw sales of 79,39,498 motorcycles (up 17 percent), 39,85,312 scooters (up 32 percent), and 3,32,684 mopeds (down 9 percent). However, these numbers are well below those of April-December 2019 (total sales: 1.39 crore units – scooters: 44,63,954, motorcycles: 89,55,215, mopeds: 4,95,805) as well as April-December 2018 (total sales: 1.65 crore units – scooters: 53,24,125, motorcycles: 1.05 crore, mopeds: 661,923). Let’s examine how each of the major players in the market performed.</p>
        <h3>Hero MotoCorp: 39,21,309 units</h3>
        <p>Hero MotoCorp, the country’s two-wheeler market leader, reported sales of 3.92 million units, up 11 percent on year-ago numbers. Of this, 36,39,140 units or 93 percent comprised motorcycles (up 10 percent) and scooters at 2,82,169 units (7 percent) made up the rest.</p>
        <h3>HMSI: 33,22,746 units</h3>
        <p>Nearly 6,00,000 units behind the market leader is Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India (HMSI). But compared to Hero, Honda has recorded a higher growth rate, which has translated into a market share increase of two percent – from 25.13 percent a year ago to 27.10 percent.</p>
        <p>HMSI sold a total of 14,28,996 bikes, up 31 percent, which gives it a market share of 18 percent versus 16 percent a year ago. However, HMSI’s strength comes from its sheer dominance in the scooter market driven by its Activa range, which recently saw the addition of the Activa H-Smart. The company has recorded sales of nearly 1.9 million scooters in the past nine months, growing 29 percent YoY and has a scooter market share of 47.51 down one percent from 48.65 percent a year ago. Put that down to a sluggish market as well as competition from the No. 3 player, TVS.  </p>

        postImage: "./images/automobile/20230124015407_Fronx_side_resized.webp",
        content: `
        <p>At Auto Expo 2023, Maruti Suzuki unveiled the Baleno-based Fronx SUV along with the much-awaited 5-door Jimny. The bookings for the Fronx are already underway and the SUV will go on sale in April this year. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fronx Sigma only available in 1.2 MT</li>
            <li>Deliveries to start in June</li>
            <li>Starting price to undercut Brezza</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Fronx is available in five trims – Sigma, Delta, Delta+, Zeta and Alpha. It comes with two powertrain options, the 90hp, 1.2-litre petrol engine and the 100hp, 1.0-litre turbo-petrol Boosterjet unit, both of which are offered with Maruti Suzuki’s mild-hybrid technology.</p>
        <h3>Maruti Suzuki Fronx Sigma: exterior, interior, features </h3>
        <p>As can be seen from the images, the Fronx Sigma gets steel wheels and black door handles and wing mirrors.  Wheel covers are a part of the equipment list, however,  the model here is not fitted with them.</p>
        <p>On the inside, the Fronx Sigma gets a dual-tone, black and blue theme and essentials like power windows, tilt adjustment for the steering wheel, and even automatic climate control. However, there is no factory-fitted stereo and the steering wheel lacks controls. </p>
        <p>Other equipment on offer includes 60:40 split folding rear seats, keyless entry and go, and fabric seat upholstery. Safety is taken care of with rear parking sensors, hill-hold assist, dual airbags and ESP. It also comes with a rear defogger but no rear wash-wipe.</p>
        <p>Features like a touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, steering-mounted controls, voice assistant and electrically adjustable wing mirrors are available from the Delta variant onwards. </p>

        title: "Toyota Hyryder waiting period extends up to 15 months",
        postImage: "./images/automobile/20230124010844_Hyryder-2.webp",
        content: `<p>The Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara and Toyota Hyryder SUVs have had a fair start in the market since their launch last year, selling a combined average of 9,000 units per month. Our dealer sources tell us that while the Hyryder's mild-hybrid variants command a maximum waiting period of up to 15 months, strong-hybrid variants see between 6-7 months.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Longer waiting period for Hyryder's mild hybrid line-up</li>
            <li>Strong-hybrid variants have a waiting period between 6-7 months</li>
            <li>Comparatively lower waiting period for the Grand Vitara</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Toyota Hyryder mild hybrid sees a longer waiting period</h3>
        <p>Toyota offers the Hyryder in four trims – E, S, G and V. As per our dealer sources, when it comes to mild hybrids, the G manual variant has a 15-month waiting period, whereas the automatic sees only 2 months. The top-spec V variant, on the other hand, has a 10-month waiting for the manual and 2 months for the automatic. The AWD version, available only on the V trim with the mild-hybrid MT powertrain, has a waiting period of 3-4 months.</p>
        <p>However, Toyota has been producing very few units (or almost none) of the base-spec Hyryder. Waiting periods for the base E and S trims on the mild hybrid line-up are currently more than 24 months, making it next to impossible to get your hands on one. In fact, sources tell us that Toyota dealers are trying to push customers more towards the higher-spec trims.</p>
        <h3>Toyota Hyryder: strong hybrid's waiting period details</h3>
        <p>The Hyryder's strong-hybrid variants are more readily available across the range. The longest a customer will have to wait for the strong hybrid is 6 to 7 months for the G trim. The top-spec V trim has an even lower waiting period of 3 to 4 months. This is because Toyota has prioritised sales of the strong-hybrid variants as was the production plan from the start, according to people in the know.</p>

        title: "Honda Activa H-Smart launched at Rs 80,537",
        postImage: "./images/automobile/20230123014428_Activa.webp",
        content: `
        <p>Honda has launched the Activa H-Smart in India at Rs 80,537. It gets a host of keyless features but remains mechanically identical to the standard Activa. The Activa H-Smart is available in six colours. Alongside the Activa H-Smart, Honda also revealed the updated prices for the Activa 6G Standard (Rs 74,536) and the Activa 6G DLX (Rs 77,036).</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Activa H-Smart gets keyless fob, electronic features</li>
            <li>Activa 6G standard, DLX prices up by Rs 1,177</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Honda Activa H-Smart: what's new?</h3>
        <p>The Honda Activa H-Smart gets an electronic key fob and brings in a bunch of electronic features, some of which are similar to that of a car. The SmartFind feature allows you to locate your vehicle by flashing all four indicators at the press of a button. The SmartStart feature allows you to start the scooter by just flipping the switch located where the key slot would be found normally.</p>
        <p>The SmartUnlock feature allows you to unlock the handlebar, the fuel filler cap and the underseat storage unit with the use of the key fob. The SmartSafe feature shuts off the keyless functionality of the fob, thereby locking the vehicle and aiding safety. Another feature separating the Activa H-Smart from the regular Activa is the presence of alloy wheels, compared to the steel units found on the Activa 6G. This marks the first time in its nearly 20-year model run that the 110cc Activa gets alloy wheels. Honda has revealed that production of the Activa H-smart will begin by the end of this week and that units will be dispatched to dealers by the end of this month. </p>
        <h3>Honda Activa H-Smart: pricing</h3>
        <p>Apart from these features, the Activa H-Smart remains identical to the standard Activa. Both standard variant and the Activa 6G DLX have received a hike of Rs 1,177, now priced at Rs 74,536 and Rs 77,036, respectively. The most direct rival to the Activa H-Smart is the TVS Jupiter but in terms of price it is positioned nearly on par with the drum variant of the TVS Ntorq. </p>
        <p>All prices mentioned are ex-showroom, Delhi.</p>

        title: "Maruti Suzuki Celerio to be sold as Toyota Vitz in South Africa",
        postImage: "./images/automobile/20230127063547_Vitz.jpg",
        content: `
        <p>The Toyota-Suzuki joint venture will see the addition of yet another new product for South Africa. The current-gen Maruti Suzuki Celerio that is made in India will be sold in South Africa as the Toyota Vitz. The new Toyota Vitz will go on sale in the coming months and will replace the Toyota Agya in the South African domestic market.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Celerio to be sold as Toyota Vitz in South Africa</li>
            <li>Will go on sale in the coming months</li>
            <li>Will not get any major mechanical changes</li>
        <ol>
        <h3>Toyota Vitz: What’s different?</h3>
        <p>A first image of the rebadged Celerio (new Toyota Vitz) has surfaced online; the car is visible from the front three quarters and looks almost similar to the current Celerio. The only visible difference is the usage of Toyota logo and Vitz badging instead of the usual Suzuki ones. While it is not confirmed, we don’t expect any major changes on the interior or mechanical side and the Celerio-based Toyota Vitz will most likely continue with the same 1.0-litre K10C DualJet petrol engine mated to either a five-speed manual or an AMT automatic. </p>
        <h3>Vitz: another reincarnated Toyota moniker</h3>
        <p>With each new Suzuki-supplied product, Toyota seems to be reincarnating older model names for the cars sold in South Africa and a few Middle Eastern markets. The trend started with Toyota introducing the previous-gen Baleno as the Toyota Starlet in South Africa and Toyota Glanza in India. The Glanza and Starlet were names of Toyota hatchbacks that were sold overseas in the 1990s and early 2000s. </p>

        title: "2023 Formula Bharat winners announced",
        postImage: "./images/automobile/20230127035630_VGN_2616.jpg",
        content: `
        <p>Now in its seventh edition, the Formula Bharat student competition has announced Veloce Racing and STES Stallion Motorsport Electric as the overall winners of the 2023 edition. Similar to the previous season, this year’s event also adopted a hybrid approach, with virtual events and on-track events at Coimbatore’s Kari Motor Speedway.</p>
        <h3>Formula Bharat: what is it?</h3>
        <p>The competition serves as a training ground for engineering students who aspire to build a future in the automotive industry. Following the rule books, the teams have to design and fabricate a formula-style prototype vehicle from scratch, along with seeking sponsorship and donations to fund the project. This not only helps them gain valuable experience in teamwork, but also in areas of management.</p>
        <p>The competition is divided in two categories – combustion and electric. A jury of experts – hailing from motorsport, automotive and supplier industries – judge the teams and their vehicles in the areas of engineering design, overall cost, marketability and dynamic performance.</p>
        <h3>2023 Formula Bharat winners</h3>
        <p>This year, Formula Bharat introduced two classes. Class I gave aspiring student teams the chance to have their conceptual designs judged by industry experts, without having to build a physical prototype. The winners of this class were already announced in November 2022, with Hermes Racing (Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology) winning in the combustion category and IITK Motorsports (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur) winning in the electric category.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Class II was conducted on-site with a total of 53 teams – 32 combustion and 21 electric. The winners of the overall event were Veloce Racing (Vishwakarma Institute of Technology) in the combustion category and STES Stallion Motorsport Electric (Kashibai Navale College of Engineering) in the electric category. The on-site event also comprised of the mandatory brake test, noise test, tilt test and more. These were followed by dynamic events, including skidpad, acceleration, autocross, efficiency and the endurance test on the track.</p>
