        title: "This wealth manager feels fiscal deficit for FY23 may be lower than government's own estimate",
        postImage: "./images/finance/high-angle-budget-wooden-blocks.jpg",
        content: `
        <p>The tax collection during the last nine months has been quite robust and much ahead of the budget estimates for the current year. Hence, there is a good possibility that the government may have a fiscal deficit number which is lower than the budgeted and that could be a positive surprise, Raghvendra Nath of Ladderup Wealth Management told in an interview.</p>
        <p>The managing director feels that if the budget signals higher growth, estimates for the next year are in line with expectations and there is no significant hike in taxes, the market should give a thumbs up and welcome Budget announcements.</p>
        <p>Raghvendra, who has over 27 years of corporate experience and a deep knowledge of the financial markets, believes while there is a good probability that 2023 may also see good returns, the returns shall be more stock specific and not so much at a broader market level. Edited excerpts:</p>
        <h3>Do you think Budget 2023 will focus on populist measures ahead of state elections or it will be growth oriented?</h3>
        <p>Over the years we have seen that most central governments maintain a good balance between social and economic objectives during the budget. So I don’t expect this year will be any different. The budget should largely be growth oriented to further the momentum of economic recovery.</p>
        <p>In the last two budgets, we have seen that the government is actively listening to the industry experts and addressing the gaps in policy and taxation. This budget should ideally further that exercise in bringing industry friendly policies that can bolster overall Economic growth.</p>

        title: "Further drop likely if Nifty falls below 17,840 | Bet on these 3 stocks for decent returns in short term",

        <p>Bears remained at the helm as the benchmark Nifty 50 index shed 226.35 points (1.25 percent) on January 25. On the daily timeframe, the index remained below the 50-day exponential moving average, which confirms the bearish trend.</p>
        <p>On the lower end, however, the drop was limited to the upper band of the falling wedge pattern on the daily chart. Sentiment looks very weak, with the RSI (relative strength index) in a bearish crossover.</p>
        <p>The Nifty 50 ended at 17,891.95 on January 25. A further drop may occur if the index falls below 17,840. On the higher end, resistance is placed at 18,000.</p>
        <p>The Nifty Bank index witnessed selling pressure throughout the session and ended at 41,647.65. On the daily chart, an upward consolidation was followed by a sharp fall, suggesting a rise in bearish bets in the space.</p>
        <h3>Here are two buy calls and one sell call for the short term:</h3>
        <h3>TVS Motor: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,038 | Stop-Loss: Rs 997 | Target: Rs 1,130 | Return: 9 percent</h3>
        <p>The stock has risen following a consolidation on the daily chart, confirming the increasing bullishness. Besides, the stock price has moved above the 50-day exponential moving average on the daily timeframe.</p>
        <p>The daily RSI is in positive divergence. In the short term, the stock may rise to Rs 1,130. On the lower end, support is pegged at Rs 997.</p>

        title: "Smartphone shipments plunge most ever as buyers spend less",

        <p>Shipments declined 18.3% in the December quarter compared to a year earlier, to a little over 300 million units, Needham, Massachusetts-based IDC said Thursday. For the year, shipments fell 11.3% and marked the lowest total for a decade, the researchers said.</p>
        <p>Global smartphone shipments suffered their worst quarterly drop on record in a clear sign of cooling consumer demand that signals more pain for manufacturing hubs like South Korea and Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Shipments declined 18.3% in the December quarter compared to a year earlier, to a little over 300 million units, Needham, Massachusetts-based IDC said Thursday. For the year, shipments fell 11.3% and marked the lowest total for a decade, the researchers said.</p>
        <p>“We have never seen shipments in the holiday quarter come in lower,” Nabila Popal, research director at IDC, said in a press release. Along with inflation and economic uncertainties, Covid lockdowns in China were another factor that hurt the industry, including sales of Apple Inc.’s iPhone, she said. “Heavy sales and promotions during the quarter helped deplete existing inventory rather than drive shipment growth.”</p>
        <p>Turmoil in Apple’s main Chinese production base may have disrupted shipments in the quarter. Protests over Covid restrictions and living conditions at the Zhengzhou complex that makes the majority of the world’s iPhones derailed production for weeks, culminating in violent protests in December.</p>
        <p>Smartphones are among the largest exports for Korea and a key source of income for Vietnam as Samsung Electronics Co. operates factories in both countries. Samsung last quarter reported its biggest profit fall in over a decade, primarily led by a drop in demand for semiconductors. The company’s exposure to smartphone sales is amplified by its role as the leading provider of memory and displays for the industry.</p>
        <p>Mobile gadget sales serve as a barometer of demand for chips. Korea’s smartphone shipments are likely to eke out just 0.7% growth this year after falling 2.1% last year, according to a Korea Development Bank forecast. Chip exports from the country will probably contract 9.8% from a year earlier in 2023, it said, adding to earlier suggestions that a recovery in demand shouldn’t be expected until the tail end of the year.</p>

        <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.9% to 557.65 and was set for its fifth straight day of gains.</p>
        <p>Asian equities rose to a fresh seven-month high on Thursday, with Hong Kong shares playing catch-up to other markets' gains as trade resumed after its three-day Lunar New Holiday.</p>
        <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.9% to 557.65 and was set for its fifth straight day of gains.</p>
        <p>The index has gained 10% so far in January, buoyed by expectations of a strong economic rebound in China and by hopes that most major central banks are nearing an end to hefty rate rises.</p>
        <p>Trading was thin on Thursday with Australia closed for a holiday and certain parts of Asia, including China, still away for the Lunar New Year.</p>
        <p>The buoyant mood looked set to continue in Europe, with the Eurostoxx 50 futures up 0.58%, German DAX futures 0.58% higher and FTSE futures up 0.30%.</p>
        <p>Traders betting that the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon tone down its aggressive rate hike policy got a lift after the Bank of Canada on Wednesday raised rates but became the first major central bank to say it would likely hold off on further increases for now.</p>
        <p>After a series of super-sized rate hikes last year, the U.S. central bank is now largely expected to raise rates by a smaller 25 basis points next week on signs that inflation is cooling.</p>
        <p>While analysts expect the Fed to eventually pause its interest rate hikes this year, for some the meeting in February is a bit too early for that.</p>

        title: "Equity mutual funds to adopt T+2 redemption payment cycle from Feb 1",

        <p><i>The announcement has come on the heels of Indian equity markets moving to a T+1 settlement cycle for all stocks.</i></p>
        <p>The announcement has come on the heels of Indian equity markets moving to a T+1 settlement cycle for all stocks, shortening the settlement cycle by a day and making the availability of funds a day sooner than at present.</p>
        <p>Commenting on the development, A Balasubramanian, managing director and chief executive officer, Aditya Birla Mutual Fund and chairman, AMFI, said, “T+1 settlement cycle for Indian equity markets is a global first. As an industry, we want to pass on the benefit to our mutual fund investors and hence we are proactively adopting a T+2 redemption payment cycle for equity funds.</p>
        <p>NS Venkatesh, chief executive, AMFI added “AMFI and its member AMCs always keep investor interest at the forefront. Since the day SEBI announced the phased movement of equity markets to the T+1 settlement cycle, the industry has been preparing to shorten the redemption payment cycle and we are happy to announce the shift to the T+2 redemption payment cycle effective February 1, 2023, onwards.</p>
        <p>As per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) directions, the Indian stock exchanges shifted to a shorter and faster ‘trade-plus-one’ (T+1) settlement cycle from January 27.</p>
        <p>Before Sebi introduced the T+2 settlement system for stocks in April 2003, India followed the T+3 settlement system, meaning it took three days for shares and money to be credited to the account. Up till now, mutual funds were following the T+3 redemption payment cycle.</p>

        title: "MC Exclusive: Sebi may force large mutual fund houses to lower fees",
        postImage: "./images/finance/sebi-1628230724.webp",
        content: `
       <p>The capital market regulator appears to have evidence that some distributors nudge investors to shift from large and existing schemes to new schemes, as they can pay higher commissions. SEBI is now looking to tighten the cost norms for mutual fund houses</p>
       <p>SEBI is contemplating reducing a mutual fund's Total Expense ratio, for larger fund houses</p>
       <p>Capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is planning to prevent large mutual fund (MF) houses from charging high expense ratios.</p>
       <p>In December 2022, the market regulator announced that it has initiated an internal study to re-look at the expenses that fund houses charge unitholders.</p>
       <p>Moneycontrol has now learnt that Sebi may put a threshold on the overall equity assets under management (AUM) of fund houses to determine the expense ratio it can charge its investors.</p>
       <p>For instance, if a fund house’s equity AUM is Rs 50,000 crore (a figure that Sebi appears to be ideating around), then the fund house’s existing schemes as well as new schemes would be made to charge a lower expense ratio, compared to what they are qualified for under the present norms.</p>
       <p>Sebi appears to have analysed MF inflow data and observed that when fund houses, especially large and mid-sized ones, launch new schemes, some distributors take their investors’ money out from existing schemes and put it in new schemes. This enables the distributors to earn a higher commission as newly-launched schemes can pay higher distribution fees.</p>
       <p>As per Sebi's present formula, schemes with an AUM of up to Rs 500 crore can charge total expense ratio (TER) of up to 2.25 percent. As the scheme grows in size, its TER comes down <see table>. SEBI’s 2018-updated TER formula accounts for a scheme’s burgeoning size; a major upgrade to its age-old formula.</p>
