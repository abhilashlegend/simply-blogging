        <p>OnePlus is all set to host a big launch on February 7th that includes many OnePlus devices. The OnePlus 11 is the limelight of the event but along with that, the OnePlus 11R and OnePlus’ very first tab, the OnePlus Pad is also launching. Last year, OnePlus launched its R version after three months after launching the OnePlus 10. </p>
        <p>OnePlus R versions are budget-friendly phones with high-end performance properties. Before any official information, the leaked configurations of the OnePlus 11R have surfaced on the internet but about the OnePlus Pad, there are no specifications online except for its design.</p>
        <h3>ONEPLUS 11R EXPECTED SPECIFICATIONS</h3>
        <p>OnePlus 11R could be powered by the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor. It might have the Adreno 730 for graphics. </p>
        <p>There are only renders on one storage variant which is 8GB RAM and 128GB storage and only one colour is expected yet; Galactic Silver.</p>
        <p>It is expected to feature a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate support. It may feature a 50-megapixel triple camera setup on the back. The OnePlus 11R will pack a 5000mAh battery with 100-watt fast charging support reportedly.</p>
        <h3>ONEPLUS PAD EXPECTED SPECIFICATIONS</h3>
        <p>The first tablet by OnePlus does not have many renders on the internet but some leaks reveal the design of the OnePlus Pad. It could feature a unibody metal chassis and slim equal bezels all around. </p>
        <p>The renders showed the OnePlus Pad in two colours green and black. It will feature an 11.6-inch display reportedly. The renders also show the volume rockers on the right side of the OnePlus Pad and there are some cutouts on the left as well. On the back, there is only one circular camera cutout but it's hard to tell how many cameras it is holding. </p>

       <h3>HIGHLIGHTS</h3>
       <ul>
       <li>The other half of the Macbook could feature a glass body.</li>
       <li>The news leak on the patent confirms that Apple might be working on new touchpad features.</li>
       <li>This could look similar to the infinite trackpad on the Dell XPS 13 and LG Gram</li>
       <ul>
       <p>Apple has recently filed a patent related to the trackpad design with the US Patent & Trademark Office. This has been found by Patently Apple.</p>
       <p>With this patent, Apple is bringing a whole new addition to its MacBook. This could look similar to the infinite trackpad on the Dell XPS 13 and LG Gram Style which was displayed at CES 2023 recently.</p>
       <p>If this is to be believed, it would mean that the second half of the Macbook could feature a glass body. Additionally, this trackpad could come with many haptic engines which will allow mimicking a physical clickable feel. With this, a lot of functionalities can be introduced that will further enable the usability of the large-sized trackpad.</p>

        <p>According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple's highly-anticipated augmented and virtual reality headset is nearing completion. The company is expected to reveal the device in the spring, ahead of its WWDC conference in June. To indicate that the launch is imminent, Apple has reportedly shared the headset with selected software developers and provided them with a preview of the new xrOS software. Gurman predicts that after the Spring announcement of Reality Pro, the device will be made available for purchase in the fall.</p>
        <p>Apple's forthcoming AR/VR headset is reportedly nearing completion and is set to be announced in the spring, ahead of the WWDC conference in June. However, the final stages of development for the device will affect the rest of Apple's 2023 product lineup. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the next versions of iOS and macOS will have fewer major changes than previously planned, as software engineers have been reassigned to work on the xrOS team. </p>
        <p>Additionally, there are no significant updates planned for Apple's iPad, Apple Watch, and audio lines. Gurman notes that new iPad Pro models with OLED displays are expected to arrive in 2024 and warns that the upcoming Apple Silicon MacPro will be another disappointment with the same design as its 2019 predecessor and no ability to upgrade the computer's RAM on your own.</p>
