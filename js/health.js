        <p>Nearly everyone has an answer to the question ‘what’s your favorite food?.’</p>
        <p>It’s easy to see why: humans are wired to derive pleasure from food. In fact, for many, eating ranks among the greatest pleasures in life!</p>
        <p>Besides making mealtimes an enjoyable experience, taking pleasure from food also has significant benefits for health. Savoring food supports digestion, can help improve your relationship with food, can help overcome disordered eating and more.</p>
        <p>In some cases, getting enough “vitamin P” (or perhaps vitamin mmmm) is just as important as the contents of your plate. Read on to dive into the tasty delights of why pleasure matters for food.</p>
        <h3>The psychology behind eating for pleasure</h3>
        <p>Over the years we have seen that most central governments maintain a good balance between social and economic objectives during the budget. So I don’t expect this year will be any different. The budget should largely be growth oriented to further the momentum of economic recovery.</p>
        <p>For years, researchers have studied the science behind eating for pleasure. Their findings are intriguing and largely encouraging.</p>
        <p>Physiologically, the pleasure people derive from food occurs both in our mouths and in our brains.</p>
        <p>“Pleasure of any kind, including pleasure from food, leads to a release of dopamine in the brain,” explains therapist, dietitian, and Certified Body Trust provider Aleta Storch, RDN, MHC, of Wise Heart Nutrition and Wellness.</p>

        <h3>Canned chickpeas</h3>
        <h4>Prep suggestions</h4>
        <p>If you have a can of chickpeas, you have the makings of all sorts of dinners (and lunches too).

        Drain the can and pop the little legumes into soups or stews for extra protein and fiber. Or mash them with lemon juice, fresh dill, and diced celery as the filling for a wrap. Then, of course, there’s the world of chickpea cakes, chickpea tacos, and chickpea salads to choose from.</p>
        <h4>Save it for later</h4>
        <p>Leftover chickpeas can be kept in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a week, and can even be frozen. For best results, dry canned chickpeas as much as possible, then place them on a baking sheet in a single layer in the freezer. Once frozen, store them in a zip-top bag or other airtight container.</p>
        <h4>Health benefits</h4>
        <p>Despite their humble appearance, chickpeas are a veritable powerhouse of nutrition.

        One cupTrusted Source of the cooked beans contains 12.5 grams of fiber, 14.5 grams of protein, and just 4 grams of fat. They’re also quite high in manganese, which supports bone health, and folate, a B vitamin that helps create new cells and form DNA.</p>

        title: "Plant-based Protein: The Best, the Worst, and Everything In Between",
        postImage: "./images/health/pexels-marta-branco-1295572.jpg",
        content: `
       <p>All aboard the plant train! As we chug along into a new year, interest in plant-based protein shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
       <p>According to the International Food Information Council’s 2022 Food and Health Survey, 12 percent of Americans now follow a plant-based diet and 31 percent say they’ve been eating more food from whole-plant sources.</p>
       <p>Meanwhile, there’s no shortage of novel plant-forward protein sources to choose from, with new powders, milks, and meat substitutes emerging every month. And, of course, old standbys like beans, quinoa, and tofu are always available to add animal-free protein to your diet too.</p>
       <p>Considering leaning more on plants to fill you up, build your muscles, and even help you lose weight?</p>
       <p>Here’s an overview of the latest science behind plant-based proteins, when to use them, and why they make a difference to the environment and your health.</p>
       <h3>The science behind plant-based protein</h3>
       <p>When comparing plant-based protein to animal protein, there are plenty of factors to consider, from taste to cost. But if you’re turning to plants for a health purpose, it’s helpful to look at the science behind their benefits.</p>

        content: `
        <p>You might be hard-pressed to find any commonalities between the children’s lullaby “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” and the k-pop hit “Dynamite” by BTS.</p>
        <p>It turns out both songs are commonly used to help people fall asleep.</p>
        <p>Surprised?</p>
        <p>So were the researchers, whose findings were published today in the scientific journal PLOS ONE.</p>
        <h3>Using music to fall asleep is common</h3>
        <p>The researchers cited previous studies indicating that close to half of people interviewed use music to help them fall asleep.</p>
        <p>However, despite how common the practice is, there’s been little detailed research on what types of music people are actually listening to for this purpose.</p>
        <p>In this study, researchers reviewed data from the audio streaming service Spotify to determine what types of music people listen to to fall asleep.</p>
        <p>While the data was anonymized, researchers noted that Spotify is used in 92 countries and that people of all ages use music streaming services. They believe this lends their study the most global look into sleep music yet.</p>

        title: "Is High Blood Pressure Genetic?",
        postImage: "./images/health/pexels-pavel-danilyuk-7108344.jpg",
        content: `
        <p>High blood pressure means the force of blood flowing through your arteries is greater than it should be. If not controlled, it could damage your blood vessels and cause other health problems.</p>
        <p>High blood pressure (hypertension) tends to be a condition we associate with being too sedentary or getting older. But high blood pressure can also be a genetic condition, affecting people who are otherwise fit and healthy.</p>
        <p>A parent with high blood pressure can pass along a gene to a child, raising that person’s risk of developing hypertension one day. Familial hypertension may also result from a family lifestyle that includes high blood pressure risk factors, such as smoking or an unhealthy diet.</p>
        <h3>What is hypertension?</h3>
        <p>Blood pressure is the force of circulating blood against the inner wall of your arteries. It’s measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is presented as two numbers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first (top) number is the systolic pressure, which is the pressure inside the artery walls during a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>The second (bottom) number is the diastolic pressure, which is the pressure when the heart is at rest.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>According to the American Heart AssociationTrusted Source, healthy blood pressure is a systolic pressure of less than 120 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of less than 80 mm Hg. This is a blood pressure of less than 120/80 mm Hg.</p>
